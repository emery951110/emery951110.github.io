               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve told you, it’s gonna be very different from other birthday cards. But I bet you would never think of this kind of “card” right? 
               Among your friend zone, maybe I’m the only one who can develop a website just for your birthday. 
               Btw, this site is actually adapted from a ready-made website, I didn’t really create this website from scratch because I’m not that smart. 
               Although sending you a Blackpink album might seem boring and uncreative, 
               with this elaborate website and my personal English voiceover, as I promised you before, 
               it just can’t be a bad birthday present, can it? I hope you’ll like it and enjoy it. So let’s dive into my deep soul and spirit now.😂
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time since we graduated from junior high school. Some classmates are still in touch but some are not in contact with each other anymore. So sad. 
               However, you’re one of the minorities who will text me and care about me. The touching emotions and feelings are just beyond description. 
               Nothing can compare to what you’ve done for me. You might think that I’m too dramatic, but every word in this letter describes how special you are, seriously. 
               You may have noticed that I’ve said I was a “neautrois”. New-troy/s or new-trwah are both correct. But what exactly does it mean? 
               Well basically, it is a non-binary gender identity that is often associated with a “neutral” gender. Simply put, it’s just a mixture of boy and girl. 
               Tell you what, when I saw a beautiful girl, unlike other “gross boys”, the first thought that came to my mind was: ”Why couldn’t I be as pretty as her? 
               How did she do her skincare? Why did her outfits look so gorgeous? What perfume did she use?” See? You could easily tell the difference between me and other kinda normal boys. 
               And when I go shopping, I always go to the stores for mostly “female”, such as Zara, H&M, Michael Kors, etc. And I’ve also been attracted to those boutique brands’ bags and purses 
               that people think only women will like instead of Nike or Under Armour. However, sometimes people will say that I’m too girlish, and even say something ruined to me like…(娘X) umm. 
               But actually, I don’t give a fuck.😀 But except you. When I post some selfies on Instagram, you always compliment me. I was astonished you know. XD 
               I can’t believe you can totally accept this kind of me, and even support me to be myself. It is an extremely precious thing to me. And I just don't know how to thank you. 
               I wish maybe someday we can hang out and shopping together. Mostly because when I went shopping with friends, I was afraid of going to those girlish stores I’ve mentioned previously. 
               But if I hang out with you, it would be much easier for me to express the “real” me. Perhaps I can give you some recommendations?😆 
               One more thing to mention, to be honest, you’re so pretty that I’ve always been jealous of you. You not only have a nice dressing style but also a fit body figure. 
               I mean, you’re exactly a “typa girl”! That was the reason why I played Blackpink’s “Typa Girl” on this website before. 
               Back to the point, As a biological male, maybe there are still some limitations and obstacles on the path to making myself good-looking due to androgen or something else. 
               But as an androgynous person, I could still at least become a hipster and maybe be your consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have already met different friends and attended different schools. The challenges and obstructions we encounter will also be different. 
               But after all, we can still support each other. Whether it’s about studying or anything trivial in your life. When you face any difficulties, feel free to get in touch with me. 
               Still, I’m always here for you. No matter what, you certainly mean a lot to me with no doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;其實在做自己的路上，遇到的事情很多，有開心的當然有不愉快的，很多人說我有種氣場，讓人不敢接近，使得我每次都不知道該怎麼辦，
               對於外表也是，往往會太過在意他人眼光，不過因為有妳，讓我知道其實還是有人能夠接受這樣的我的。
               對我來說，我很喜愛任何美的事情，無論是外表、是服裝、是個性，往往都能吸引我的目光，而我也會希望能夠被那些美的事物所環繞，
               因此我的服裝風格和個性甚至於想法都會比較不像社會所認為的「男生」，跟同學出去逛街也都不太會去逛那些比較「女性化」的商店，
               但其實那才是我真正想逛的地方，不過即便進去了那些商店，也常常遇到尺寸或版型不合的窘境(所以我的鞋子很多都是盜版的，這樣才會有我的尺寸XD)，
               即便身邊的人能夠接受這樣的我，也常常會被誤以為是Gay，但我明明就是喜歡女生阿QQ，anyway可以說的東西實在太多了，有機會再說吧😜。
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;身處一間男校，身邊的人的個性往往都與我不同，想感性的時候也沒有人可以聊，也很少會討論到喜歡的議題，大家聊的東西要嘛是動漫要嘛是遊戲，
               沒有甚麼人是真的能夠談心的，而且之後我選的路會比別人還要難走很多，遇到的困難在宜蘭也往往是極少數人才能夠幫我的(有機會可以聊聊拉~)。
               總之，很高興妳沒有忘記我，而我也沒有忘記我要唸英文XD 雖然好像每次我在生日卡片裡講的東西都很離題(?，但每次都一定是妳做了哪些事情，才使我得以寫出這些東西……
               還有阿，要對自己有自信喔，有好事發生也要分享給我嘿，偷偷跟妳縮，我打算繼續朝著長髮邁進XD，改天應該向你請教一下頭髮護理(?😝
               老實說，妳大概算是國高中階段影響我最多的人了，無論是在性格、談吐、想法、交際、審美(? 都使我改變了很多，
               而且阿，當初阿宏說妳頭髮很香的時候，我還特地跑去找類似的味道，結果就被我找到了「白麝香」這個美妙的香調😍😍，太感謝妳了XDDD
